# Banana-Node in Amabri view
Thanks at [tarek-salak](https://github.com/tarek-salah) for the original [banana-node](https://github.com/tarek-salah/banana-node)
The Banana project was forked from Kibana, and works with all kinds of time series (and non-time series) data stored in Apache Solr. It uses Kibana's powerful dashboard configuration capabilities, ports key panels to work with Solr, and provides significant additional capabilities, including new panels that leverage D3.js.

The goal is to create a rich and flexible UI, enabling users to rapidly develop end-to-end applications that leverage the power of Apache Solr. Data can be ingested into Solr through a variety of ways, including LogStash, Flume and other connectors.
